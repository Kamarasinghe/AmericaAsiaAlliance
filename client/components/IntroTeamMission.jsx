                  licensed Realtor and property manager in Nevada. He has been a successful entrepreneur for over twenty-five years, starting out on 
                  the East Coast and the Midwest during the 1990’s as both a real estate investor and restaurant owner. Through his unwavering efforts 
                  and determination, Kenny eventually grows his business to include several furniture stores, warehouse locations, a food supply 
                  distribution company, and an import/export business. Over the years, he began to expand his reach to the West Coast, and moved his 
                  headquarters to the Los Angeles area where he continued to flourish – at one time owning over 400,0002 feet retail and 150,0002 feet 
                  warehouse space, respectively. Upon relocating to Las Vegas from California in 2011, he struck gold buying foreclosures and rental 
                  properties. He realized that he was able to cater to an underserved segment of investors, and has helped his clients close hundreds 
                  of single family homes during his career. In addition, Kenny has flipped over five hundred homes in Las Vegas. By consistently 
                  maintaining an involvement in property management and retail sales, he has strategically shifted focus towards the commercial development 
                  of multi-use properties. Beginning with an opportunity in the local condo market, Kenny has grown dramatically to include large commercial 
                  properties such as the recently acquired Laughlin Marina and a newly approved multi-use condo/retail/office center located on Hoover and 
                  6th Street in Downtown Las Vegas Nevada.
